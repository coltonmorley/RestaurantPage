            <div class="section content">Founded in the vibrant heart of Las Vegas, Steve's Bar and Grill has grown from a single, cozy establishment to a beloved chain 
                with locations spanning the beautiful West Coast. Our journey began in 2024 when Colton Morley, a passionate foodie with a dream, opened the doors to a 
                place where great food, good times, and a warm, welcoming atmosphere come together.</div>
            <div class="section content">At Steve's Bar and Grill, we believe that every meal should be a memorable experience. Our menu is a celebration of classic 
                American cuisine with a modern twist, featuring everything from mouthwatering burgers and sizzling steaks to fresh salads and innovative appetizers. 
                Whether you're here for a casual lunch, a family dinner, or a night out with friends, we have something to satisfy every craving.
            </div>
            <div class="section content">Over the years, we've expanded our footprint to several key cities across the West Coast, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, 
                and Portland. Each location maintains the unique charm and personality that Steve envisioned, while also embracing the local culture and community.  Join us at Steve's 
                Bar and Grill, where tradition meets innovation, and every guest is treated like family. We look forward to serving you and creating unforgettable memories together.</div>
